## Game todos (Jame Gam 50)
- [ ] Upgrades only accessible after one "black hole day" passes. This will be the resting point.
- [ ] progression way too slow. Tweak things
- [ ] Gravity wave mechanic needs some fleshing out. 
        - Gravity wave not activated at first.
        - After being activated, upgrade frequency with 3 upgrades, upgrade power (effect on whale) by 5 upgrades
- [ ] Click & resource generation
        -  Speed up resource generation with 5 click upgrades (drop multiplier)
        - Auto-generate resources with something more than krill, maybe a building
        - Upgrade krill by making them teleport to whale every X seconds, punch harder, punches have X chance to make whales sing
- [ ] Add loops within loops and moments of rest?
- [ ] Put in something to stick around for “one more minute”
- [ ] Add unlocked window like achievements window, but for new buildings.
- [ ] Add tutorial at the beginning (optional) which features a talking charater + Timed text + spotlight + uses timer groups to stop game functionality while explanation is going on.
    Things to explain w/ tutorial:
        1. Whale interaction via clicking
        2. Building placement 
        3. Resource conversion
        4. Gravitational wave
- [ ] Space whales with different modifiers & rarities? but what kind? How are new whales purchased? What is the point of rarities?
- [ ] Make converters & buildings text categories
- [ ] remove tooltips from krill & whales, add them somewhere else
- [ ] isolate grid shader to building placement mode only
- [ ]  1. First part(Long idea) (Second part easy fix) Just an idea, could go any way though: Well, we have done speech bubble tutorials for are game jams, but it doesnt really work that well nor is it very engaging if not done right, you have to find a way to integrate it. I would say maybe a cool way to do so would be to start the game off without the whale, and then have an astronought guy in a mask(so you dont gotta draw a face) in very short but effective diaglog prompts informs the player that they have been tracking down a "Species name here" space whale as it produces a rare resource that makes hyper space possible for spaceships. Somehting along those lines(could be very different, but just as a jist) then the space whale appears through a rift or smthg and the guy tells the player they must use some sort of tool(replace cursor with that tool) to harvest the resources. and then must collect the resource. Then after you collect like X amount of resources the space whale dissapears into another rift(that it creates) then the guy says resource can also be used to create other space technologies some very useful in collection, he then says place a collection thing after you do so, then he says ok seems like you got the hang of things and then leaves. (Since the theme seems to be more symbyotic, you would maybe want to explain that in the tutorial, and have the tutor person be some alien species or smthg. (edited)
    THen after a bit the gravitational wave spawns in and the guy repears and explains it a bit and disappears. That is just a rough idea of what i think could fit. I do think you should add some sort of whale teleportation since that is one of the things space whales are known for, and it could help provide lore for some of the upgrades and purpose of the collection. (you could tell the character they are in the 4th dimension that is where space folds over on itself granting faster than light travel and it is the fabric the space whales use to travel. which would explain colorful bg, and then you could add multiple whales (some rarer, like they have stripes or spots idk, and then a log book that shows species discovered as well as a satisfying rarirty border like legendary.mythicals common, rare, etc it also has some cool lore facts about each species,) different whales could drop different amounts of the resources, and you could then also add upgrades for having the player more likely to find rarer whales which would increase production. Stuff like that. I just dumped a ton, if you just want to get it a a bit mor intuitive i would say:
- [ ] 1. Add a magnifiying glass tool that can select and then clicks stuff like the whale or grav wave thingy and it will give a descriotion of what it does and how to use it. (edited)
    The first idea would be a lot to add. So i would say the magnifying glass would work well if you just want to get it working.
    SOme fixes/improvments: -make grid appear only when placing. -notify user when a building is unlocked, otherwise they have no idea
