## Strategy Tips for All Builds

1. **Focus Your Skills**: Don't spread your experience too thin. Master your primary combat skill first.
2. **Know When to Run**: DCSS is a game of survival. If a fight looks dangerous, retreat and find another way.
3. **Use Your Consumables**: Don't die with a bag full of potions and scrolls. Use them early and often.
4. **Worship a God**: Most characters are significantly stronger with divine help. Find an altar early.
