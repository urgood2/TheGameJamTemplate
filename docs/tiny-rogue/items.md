## Weapons

**Total Weapons**: 400

Weapons are the primary means of dealing damage. Each weapon has specific stat scaling, attack speed, damage type, and potential evolution paths.

### Weapon Categories

| Category | Subcategories | Count | Characteristics |
|----------|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Melee** | Swords, Axes, Spears, Daggers, Flails, Scythes, Hammers | ~200 | Close-range, typically STR/DEX scaling |
| **Ranged** | Bows, Crossbows, Guns, Throwing weapons, Chakrams, Boomerangs | ~150 | Distance attacks, typically DEX scaling |
| **Magic** | Wands, Staves, Tomes, Scrolls, Musical Instruments | ~50 | Spell-based, typically INT scaling |

### Stat Scaling System

Weapons scale with player attributes: **STR** (Strength), **DEX** (Dexterity), **INT** (Intelligence).

**Scaling Grades:**

| Grade | Soft Cap | Bonus Damage |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **S** | 50 | Highest scaling |
| **A** | 40 | High scaling |
| **B** | 30 | Medium scaling |
| **C** | 20 | Low scaling |
| **D** | 10 | Minimal scaling |
| **-** | - | No scaling |

**Soft Caps**: Beyond the soft cap for each grade, further stat investment yields diminishing returns.

**Example Scaling:**
```
Excalibur (STR: A, DEX: S, INT: -)
- 30 STR + 50 DEX = Strong damage
- 50 STR + 30 DEX = Moderate damage
- 0 STR + 0 DEX + 50 INT = Base damage only
```

### Weapon Upgrades & Evolution

Weapons can be upgraded to **level 4** using upgrade materials. Some legendary weapons **evolve** into more powerful forms at upgrade level 4.

**Evolution Example:**
```
Excalibur (Level 4) → True Excalibur
```

### Example Legendary Weapon

## Equipment Rarity System

All equipment follows a standardized rarity system:

```
Common → Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary → Set
```

### Rarity Effects

| Rarity | Color | Base Stats | Special Effects | Drop Rate |
|--------|-------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Common** | White/Gray | Low | None | Very High |
| **Uncommon** | Green | Medium | Occasional | High |
| **Rare** | Blue | Medium-High | Common | Medium |
| **Epic** | Purple | High | Frequent | Low |
| **Legendary** | Orange/Gold | Very High | Always | Very Low |
| **Set** | Cyan/Teal | Variable | Set bonuses | Event/Boss |

### Identifying Rarity

- **Color coding** on item cards
- **Visual effects** on dropped items (glow, particles)
- **Stat ranges** increase with rarity
- **Special effects** more powerful on higher rarities

---

## Attunement System

Equipment must be **attuned** before effects activate. This prevents micromanagement during combat.

### Attunement Mechanics

- **Attunement Requirement**: 1-3 combat rooms (varies by rarity)
- **Attuned Status**: Equipment effects become active
- **Unequipping**: Removes attunement, requires re-attunement

**Attunement Duration by Rarity:**

| Rarity | Combat Rooms Required |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Common | 1 |
| Uncommon | 1 |
| Rare | 2 |
| Epic | 2 |
| Legendary | 3 |
| Set | 3 |

### Attunement Strategy

**Example:**
```
Floor 1, Room 1: Equip Legendary Sword (0/3 rooms)
Floor 1, Room 2: Combat (1/3 rooms)
Floor 1, Room 3: Combat (2/3 rooms)
Floor 1, Room 4: Combat (3/3 rooms) → ATTUNED
```

**Design Intent**: Prevents players from swapping equipment mid-fight for specific enemy types. Encourages commitment to builds.
