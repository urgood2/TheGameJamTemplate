    content: When planning complex UI overhauls, conduct structured interviews to
      gather requirements before implementation. Ask about visual states
      (normal, hover, selected), navigation methods (mouse, keyboard, gamepad),
      animation timing (instant vs delayed), and what existing elements should
      be removed vs retained.

    content: When integrating panels that need to appear as a visual pair, calculate
      total width of both panels plus gap, then derive starting X from screen
      center minus half that total. This ensures both panels remain centered as
      a unit regardless of screen resolution.
