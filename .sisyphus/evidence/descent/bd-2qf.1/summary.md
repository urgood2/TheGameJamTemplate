# A1 Spec Snapshot + spec.lua mirror

- Added `planning/descent_spec.md` with explicit decisions for movement, turn costs, FOV, combat, HP/MP/XP, floors, inventory, scrolls, boss, and backtracking.
- Added `assets/scripts/descent/spec.lua` as a code mirror for constants used by runtime/tests.

Tests: not run (spec/data-only changes).
