# Synergies — High-Value Compositions (POA Ultrawork Style)

## Element Scaling Reference
| Element | Scaling | Best Delivery | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Venom | Linear with hit-rate | Serpent/Butterfly/Beam + Track | Drives Mana Absorption loops |
| Fire | Source-based | High-base payloads (Meteor, Star Arrow, Nova) | Avoid on low-damage spam |
| Thunder | Target-count chain | Ricochet/Volley/Cluster | Room clear |
| Frost/Slime | Control | Fast hitters early slots | Safety first |

## Top Synergy Patterns
- **Mana Battery Loop**: Mana Absorption + high-tick projectile (Serpent/Butterfly/Nova shards) → net-positive MP; funds Volley payloads.
- **Echo + AOE**: Echo + Arcane Nova/Black Hole/Meteor → doubles radius/hits.
- **Track + Serpent**: Guarantees Poison ticks; scales linearly with hit frequency.
- **Area Boost + Mimicry**: Copy passives across wands to multiply area/damage.
- **Reflection/Ricochet + Beam**: Fill rooms with bouncing lasers; add Venom for DoT stacking.
- **Post-Slot Chargers**: 777/Frenzy/Rusty Blaster/Book of Tranquility + payload in post-slot → passive bursts.
- **Fuse + Volley**: Force payload timing and cost discount together.

## Summon Synergies
- **Fusion Summon + Indomitability + Energy Saving**: Durable fused summons that don’t one-shot; cheap upkeep.
- **Grimoire Hive**: Autonomous Grimoire swarm + Fusion Summon; each carries on-hit effects.

## Resource & Safety
- Pair Slime/Frost with mana batteries to stabilize recharges.
- Keep a low-cost control wand to bridge long cooldown volley wands.

## Anti-Synergies
- Fire on low-damage spam (wasted source-based burn).
- Volley without homing (wasted discount + mana).
- All offense, no control (poor survival in dense rooms).
