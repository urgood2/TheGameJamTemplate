- A day loop where one day ends, you go to a shop screen.
- How would we manuever entities away from the rain?
- There should be a mechanic that gives a reward for the risk of entering the rain. Maybe the rain/storm should be deterministic instead of random, in that case?
- Triggers: on getting wet, on one walk step, on evading rain, on attacking a colonist who has been "corrupted" by the rain - these triggers could do something. - Maybe we can base relics on them and sell them in the shop. Which begs the question, where does the currency come from? Maybe rained-on colonist produce coin for some negative consequence in return.

- [ ] #to-process 23:06 copy station where units will go to be copied, random umbrella effects/ always reduces health
- [ ] Currency: gold start with 5
- [ ] Copy station is 5 gold
- [ ] Homes produce 1 colonist, 1 gold every 2 days
- [ ] Buy weather events (thunderstrom, snowstorm, firedtorm, rain) which will impact colonists differently based on their umbrella tags, always damages them
