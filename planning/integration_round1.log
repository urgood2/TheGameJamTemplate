The integrated plan is now at `/data/projects/TheGameJamTemplate/planning/PLAN_v1.md`. The key changes integrated are:

1. **Update order fix** (critical correctness)
2. **Event envelope standardization** (reliability)
3. **Lifecycle manager requirement** (leak prevention)
4. **Multi-trigger DSL** (clarity)
5. **Shop/loot separation** (clarity)
6. **Determinism QA requirements** (debuggability)

The ReactionSystem is included in minimal form as a calculated scope expansion with high gameplay value. Optional features (daily seed, wand upgrades) are explicitly deferred.
