## Project Overview

**Game Title:** Trigger Survivors *(working title)*
**Genre:** Survivors-like with Wand Crafting
**Art Style:** Pixel Art
**Color Palette:** Resurrect-64 (Lospec)

### Brief Description

Trigger Survivors is a wave-based survival game where players fight hordes of enemies while collecting and combining unique equipment. The core mechanic involves **crafting custom wands by stacking spell effects together** — similar to Noita's wand-building system but in a survivors-style gameplay loop.

**Key Gameplay Elements:**
- Wave-based survival against enemy hordes
- Modular wand crafting system (Triggers → Actions → Modifiers)
- Equipment collection and synergies
- Pixel art aesthetic with vibrant colors

## Deliverables

The artist has **creative freedom** on composition and style within these guidelines.

### Required Sizes

| Platform | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Steam Header Capsule | 460 × 215 | ~2.14:1 | Primary store listing |
| Steam Small Capsule | 231 × 87 | ~2.66:1 | Browse/search results |
| Itch.io Cover | 630 × 500 | 1.26:1 | Game page header |
| Itch.io Thumbnail | 315 × 250 | 1.26:1 | Browse grid |

**Recommendation:** Design for the largest size first (Itch.io 630×500), then create cropped/adapted versions for Steam capsules.

### Visual Themes

- **Vibrant & Colorful** — Not grimdark; magical and energetic
- **Chunky Pixel Art** — Readable at small sizes, detailed icons
- **Magic/Spell Emphasis** — Projectiles, glowing effects, arcane energy
- **Action-Oriented** — Convey the chaos of fighting hordes

## Suggested Visual Elements

These are **suggestions only** — the artist has creative freedom to interpret the game's identity.

### Potential Focal Points (pick one or combine)

1. **Wand Crafting** — Show spell cards/icons combining into a powerful wand
2. **Horde Combat** — Player character surrounded by enemies, casting spells
3. **Spell Effects** — Showcase the variety of colorful projectiles/abilities
4. **Item Collection** — Feature the diverse equipment icons

### Must Include

- **Game Title:** "Trigger Survivors" (or abbreviated if space is tight)
- **Readable at thumbnail size** — Title must be legible at 231×87

### Avoid

- Generic "survivor" tropes without the wand-crafting identity
- Dark/muddy colors that don't represent the vibrant palette
- Overly busy compositions that become unreadable at small sizes
