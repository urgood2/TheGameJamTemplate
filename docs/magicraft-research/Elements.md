# Elements & Status Taxonomy (POA Ultrawork Style)

> Source: Magicraft Wiki (Status Effects, crystals/cores). Elements are applied via Boost spells (Crystals/Cores). Interaction focus: tick-rate vs source-based scaling.

## Status Effect Taxonomy
| Element | Delivery | Behavior | Scaling Hook | Removal/Interaction |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Frost** | Frost Crystal | Slow/Freeze | Duration scales with effect strength | Melted by Fire; great early control |
| **Venom (Poison)** | Venom Crystal | DoT | **Linear with hit-rate/ticks** | Amplify with homing multihit |
| **Slime** | Slime Crystal | Heavy slow/trail | Applications stack | Synergizes with control |
| **Flame** | Core of Flame | Burn | **Source-based (base dmg)** 5% max HP/s (boss ~0.3%) | Strong on high base payloads |
| **Thunder** | Core of Thunder | Shock/Chain | Target count | Amplify with Ricochet/Volley |
| **Water** | Water projectiles (Condensed Bubble, High-pressure Stream) | Enables chain with Thunder | Hit coverage | Wet status aids Thunder |

## Reaction/Combo Matrix (practical)
| Combo | Result | Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Fire + Air (Volley Nova/Fireworks) | Explosive AOE | Room clear |
| Ice/Frost + Earthy payloads | Crystal/petrify lanes | Lane control |
| Water + Thunder | Enhanced chaining | Crowd deletion |
| Dark/Light (Void-style) | Endgame damage fusion | Boss phases |
| Slime + Poison | Extreme slow + ticking DoT | Safety + sustain |

---

## Application Patterns
- **Tick stacking (Venom/Slime)**: Use Serpent/Butterfly + Track; pair Mana Absorption to sustain.
- **Base-damage burns (Fire)**: Save for Meteor/Star Arrow/Arcane Nova; avoid on low-damage spam.
- **Control-first (Frost/Slime)**: Slot early to survive waves; enables long CD payloads.
- **Chain clears (Thunder)**: Pair with Ricochet/Volley; thrives in dense rooms.

---

## Design Insights
- Elements are multiplicative with slot logic: homing increases effective application; volley multiplies status reach; fuse enables timed status before payloads.
- Source vs Tick: Choose Fire for big hits, Poison for many hits. Thunder for multi-target coverage; Frost/Slime for safety.
