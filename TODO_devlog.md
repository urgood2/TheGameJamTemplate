  - tweak CRT shader vignette intensity to be more subtle
  - add "Start Action Phase" button to UI (non-functional for now)

  - Did some ideation for how to vary triggers, with activation chance for instance.
  - Tested entity state switching between planning and action phases. Seems to work fine.
