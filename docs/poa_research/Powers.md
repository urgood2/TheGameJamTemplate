## Implementation Priority for Survivors-Like

### High Priority (Core Mechanics)
1. **On-Hit Procs** - Fire damage on every attack, lightning chains, etc.
2. **Effect Stacking** - Scorch, Freeze, Sickness, Doom stacks for damage amp
3. **Stand Still Actions** - Turret/channeling gameplay
4. **Transformations** - Form changes with stacking bonuses

### Medium Priority (Build Diversity)
1. **Self-Damage Powers** - Risk-reward mechanics
2. **Master Effects** - Immunity to own status effects
3. **Summoner Powers** - Minion scaling
4. **Hybrid Damage** - Physical + elemental combos

### Lower Priority (Advanced)
1. **Teleport Powers** - Complex positioning
2. **Ally Count Scaling** - Requires robust summon system
3. **Dodge/Block Counters** - Defense-to-offense conversion
4. **Equipment-Dependent** - Bare Fist, Two-Handing requirements
